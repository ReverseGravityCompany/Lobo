# Lobo : Privacy policy

### Welcome to the Lobo Game!

## **Privacy Policy**



We take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

We have not programmed this game to collect any personally identifiable information. All data is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by us, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and we will surely try to fix it/help you.
